## Minutes
### Discussion

Students : What is Sanchay ?
Mentor: It is a syntactic annotation tool that is used by people involved in NLP.
	Students: (confused) What is syntactic annotation and do we need to know concepts of NLP
			   to complete the project ?
		Mentor: No, you do not need to know NLP concepts to do the work involved.

Students : So what exactly do we have to do in it ?
	Mentor: Right now Sanchay is an offline tool which need to be installed on a clients 
			machine in order to do any annotation work.What is required is to make it into
			a server client application so that a user can operate it without installing it
			on his system.It's previous developer tried to make it so but was not able to do 
			so.
			This server client application should segregate users based on his privilage 
			level i.e a system should be implemented so that different sets of
			users have different privelages and restrictons to different files.
			A version tracking feature should also be present so that a user can access the different
			versions of the same file which he saved at different times in the past.
			

Students: Is there any way in which we can contact the head developer of this project for
		  any technical guidance?
	Mentor: Currently he is a professor in IIT- BHU so it might not be possible to contact him 
			for any technical guidance.

Students: In the project description is was written that we have to add support for different NLP
		  tools like chunkers etc. What are they and how do we have to implement them in the application?
	Mentor:Those tasks are for future.For now you explore the codebase and try implementing the above 
			mentioned features within the end of this month.

Students: (for re confirmation) So basically we have to port the application so that is becomes
		   a server client application,has different file access restrictions for different users and 
		   tracks and makes available different versions of the same file.
	Mentor: Yes 

TA: That looks like a straightforward task.You should ask the mentor what tools,frameworks,languages
	are required.
	Students: In the project description Java was mentioned.
			

### Action Points
Have an understaning of the codebase of Sanchay.

Learn and revise Java concepts.

Learn and understand different Java web frameworks.
