Functionality
If we press w key while standing in front of a ladder and then release the key instantaneouslt the player falls from the ladder.

Functionality
A player may get killed instantaneously at the beginning of the level due to collision with a fireball.This happens because next level is displayed at a delay of 2-3 whereas the game starts functionaing instaneously in the background.

Functionality
A fireball does not fall down the entire ladder but jumps to the platfrom after covering half of its distance on the ladder.

Pythonic
Use of super on an old styled class.
Like -> super(Player,self).__init__(0,0,50,70,'p2_stand.png')

Pythonic
An attribute defined in Player class hides a method
__check_princess

-----------------------
Code Smell
Lazy class / Freeloader: a class that does too little.
Person,BrokenLadder,LadderBlock,RopeBlock,Coin classes,Cage are too small.

Cyclomatic Complexity
Too much use of if/else/for loops in update() in Player class.
In the main game loop in main.py

Large class
Player,Landforms classes have grown too large must be refactored.

Inappropriate Intimacy
Player,Landform,Item,Board classes have too much dependency on implementation details of other classes.

Feature Envy
Board class uses methods of other classes excessively.

Too many parameters
init function of Person,Item,Donkey and extract_graphic(...) of Graphics class have too many parameters.

Long method
main() in main.py
init of Board class

Code duplication
Identical code 
for LevelOne, LevelTwo, LevelThree classes.
for class ZeroPlatform, FirstPlatform, SecondPlatform, ThirdPlatform.
for Ladder and BrokenLadder

When you only press 'spacebar' instead of moving up and then returning to the same spot, the player moves up and moves right to a different spot.

After playing the game for a few minutes when the user gets hit by a fireball the game abruptly ends showing IndexError: list index out of range.

Input/Output Related
When we press 'spacebar' to jump ,player moves to a new position in the left.If we again press a 'spacebar' the player does not jump this time.It remains static on its position.

Some coins float in midair instead of being on a platform.

Coins are getting regenerated in the same level,whenever the player is dying.

Excessive use of literals:
